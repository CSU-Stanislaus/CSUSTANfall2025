# Chapter 1 — Intro to Computers, Java & Generative AI (One-Page Summary)

## What this chapter covers
- The big picture of **hardware & software**, the **data hierarchy** (bits → bytes → fields → records → files → databases), and where **Java** fits.
- Why Java remains widely used (desktop, server, Android, embedded) and its **SE / EE (Jakarta EE) / ME** editions.
- A typical **Java development workflow**: Edit → Compile (`javac`) → Load → Verify → Execute (`java`) and running single-file sources.
- Fundamentals of the **Internet, Web, Cloud, and IoT**, plus trends like **edge computing** and **mashups** (reusing web APIs).
- Essential **object-oriented ideas**: classes, objects, methods, messages (method calls), attributes (instance variables), encapsulation, interfaces, inheritance, UML.
- Modern computing forces: **Moore’s Law**, **multi-core** and **concurrency**.
- A fast tour of **data analytics**, **data science**, **big data** (the “4 Vs”), and **AI / ML / DL / RL**.
- Emerging spaces: **Metaverse (VR/AR/MR/XR)**, **Blockchain**, **Crypto**, **Web3**.
- Developer tooling & practices: **APIs**, **open-source libraries**, **version control (Git)**, **refactoring**, **design patterns**, **agile**, **TDD**, **microservices**, **containers**.

## Key takeaways (at a glance)
- **Computer organization**: input → memory → ALU/CPU → output, with **secondary storage** for non-volatile data.
- **Java strengths**: portability (“write once, run anywhere”), rich **Java API**, and rapidly evolving releases (semiannual cadence; LTS every two years).
- **Program dev environment**: learn the CLI (`javac`, `java`) even if you use an IDE; understand **bytecode**, the **JVM**, **JIT**, and **runtime errors vs logic errors**.
- **OO mindset**: model the world with **objects**; hide details (**encapsulation**); prefer **reuse** (APIs, libraries) to reinventing the wheel.
- **Concurrency matters**: multi-core CPUs and GPUs demand thinking in **threads/tasks** to exploit parallelism.
- **Data → Insight → Action**: from statistics and analytics (descriptive) to data science (predictive/optimizing) at massive scales.
- **AI today**: practical systems across vision, speech, translation, recommendation, code generation; **transformers** and **LLMs** power modern GenAI.
- **Ethics & reliability**: verify AI outputs; be mindful of **bias**, **hallucinations**, and **energy costs** at data-center scale.
- **Ecosystem literacy**: know other popular languages (Python, C/C++, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Swift, Rust, Go) and when to use them.

## Practical “do-now” checklist
- Install an **LTS JDK**; practice `javac`/`java` with a tiny program.
- Explore the **Java API docs** for common utilities (collections, I/O, streams).
- Write one small **OO** class (attributes + methods) and diagram it in **UML**.
- Time a simple computation in **single-threaded vs. parallel** form to feel concurrency.
- Call one **public web API** in a Java demo (a “mashup”); log and handle errors cleanly.
- Create a repo; practice **Git basics** (branch, commit, merge, PR).

## Terms to remember
**Bit/Byte**, **Field/Record/File/Database**, **Compiler vs. Interpreter**, **Bytecode/JVM/JIT**, **Encapsulation/Inheritance/Interface**, **Concurrency/Threads**, **API/Library**, **Big Data (4Vs)**, **ML/DL/RL**, **Transformer/Attention/LLM**, **VR/AR/MR/XR**, **Blockchain/Smart Contracts/NFTs**, **CI/CD**, **Containers (Docker)**, **Microservices**.

### Why it matters for you (course lens)
This chapter sets the vocabulary and mental models you’ll use all term: how programs run, how to think in objects, how Java’s platform works, and how modern software relies on reuse (APIs, libraries, cloud). Mastering these foundations lets you ship reliable Java code—and evaluate when to bring in concurrency, data, or AI to solve real problems.
